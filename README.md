# PBI Lineage Backend

Standalone FastAPI backend for Power BI, Microsoft Fabric, and optional
Snowflake metadata discovery, report definition retrieval, PBIR normalization,
physical-source discovery, lineage graph construction, and impact analysis.

This backend is being split out from the original Streamlit-based PBI Lineage
Explorer so the application can evolve into a cleaner service-oriented
architecture.

## What This Service Does

Current capabilities:

- Starts Microsoft device-code authentication for local/backend testing.
- Stores short-lived in-memory auth sessions.
- Lists Power BI workspaces.
- Gets one Power BI workspace.
- Lists Power BI reports in a workspace.
- Gets one Power BI report.
- Gets one report from the authenticated user's My workspace.
- Lists report pages.
- Gets one report page.
- Lists Power BI semantic models/datasets in a workspace.
- Lists Power BI gateways for which the authenticated user is an administrator.
- Gets connection metadata for one datasource on an accessible Power BI gateway.
- Lists datasources on an accessible Power BI gateway.
- Retrieves Fabric report definitions.
- Decodes and normalizes PBIR report definitions.
- Extracts visual titles, visual positions, visual types, page metadata, and
  semantic model references from PBIR.
- Extracts visual field references for columns, measures, hierarchies, sorts,
  filters, and projections.
- Retrieves Fabric semantic model definitions in TMDL/TMSL format.
- Parses TMDL semantic model definitions into tables, columns, measures,
  relationships, hierarchies, calculated tables, and Power Query partitions.
- Carries semantic model source-path evidence into lineage matches.
- Extracts XMLA semantic model metadata through an ADODB COM/MSOLAP adapter
  when the host has the Analysis Services OLE DB provider configured.
- Combines parsed Fabric TMDL and XMLA metadata into a source-preserving
  semantic metadata response with object reconciliation evidence.
- Adds lineage diagnostics with match confidence, candidate suggestions, and
  summary counts by status and object type.
- Exposes provider authentication/scope diagnostics.
- Validates Fabric report definition formats separately from semantic model
  definition formats.
- Surfaces provider error details for Fabric request and operation failures.
- Runs in a deployed Windows container environment with COM, ADODB, and MSOLAP
  available at runtime.
- Is publicly hosted over HTTPS through Cloudflare DNS, an AWS Application Load
  Balancer, and a private Windows ECS task.
- Parses measure, calculated-column, and calculated-table DAX references and
  reports unresolved references and dependency cycles.
- Extracts supported Power Query/M connectors, native SQL objects, navigation
  targets, files, URLs, storage accounts, and query-to-source mappings.
- Parses an allowlisted, non-secret subset of gateway `connectionDetails` and
  matches gateway datasources to detected query sources.
- Builds canonical upstream-to-downstream lineage graphs spanning physical
  sources, queries, semantic objects, DAX dependencies, and report visuals.
- Provides reverse impact, graph search, and upstream/downstream navigation.
- Discovers workspace-level report/semantic-model inventory and bindings.
- Authenticates live Snowflake connector sessions with password/MFA, in-memory
  RSA private keys, external-browser SSO for interactive local hosts, or OAuth.
- Traces Snowflake table or column lineage beyond the provider's five-level
  `SNOWFLAKE.CORE.GET_LINEAGE` call limit by expanding boundary objects in
  bounded parallel waves. The supplied procedure logic runs in the backend;
  no stored procedure is installed in a customer account.
- Retains the earlier optional Snowflake SQL API path for normalizing
  `ACCOUNT_USAGE.OBJECT_DEPENDENCIES` evidence supplied with a bearer token.
- Persists versioned graph snapshots in SQLite, detects incremental changes,
  caches graph reads, runs asynchronous scan jobs, and validates lineage quality.
- Builds synchronous or asynchronous live lineage scans from workspace/model
  IDs and an optional report ID using the current Fabric and Power BI session.
  Provider tokens stay in process memory and are never written to scan-job
  payloads or graph storage.
- Provides configurable API-key enforcement, secure headers/cookies, trusted
  hosts, request-size limits, readiness checks, and Prometheus-format metrics.

Remaining acceptance and scale work:

- Improve semantic model parser coverage for more TMDL shapes.
- Run live XMLA acceptance validation against a Power BI/Fabric capacity.
- Run live Snowflake authentication and deep-lineage acceptance with a role
  permitted to call `SNOWFLAKE.CORE.GET_LINEAGE`.
- Add production-grade auth/session storage.
- Move lineage persistence and scan coordination to shared infrastructure before
  running multiple API workers/tasks.
- Expand DAX and Power Query grammar coverage with tenant-derived fixtures.
- Automate ECS task-definition registration and service rollout after an
  immutable Amazon ECR image is published.
- Add production high availability, alarms, and autoscaling.

PowerAI is intentionally deferred until the backend and frontend lineage
workflows are complete. No PowerAI endpoint or service is included in this phase.

## Technology Stack

- Python 3.11+
- FastAPI
- Pydantic / Pydantic Settings
- httpx
- MSAL
- Snowflake Connector for Python
- cryptography for in-memory RSA key loading
- uv
- pytest / pytest-asyncio
- ruff
- Windows Docker Engine / Windows Server Core LTSC 2025

## Quick Start

Install/sync dependencies:

```powershell
uv sync
```

Run the development server:

```powershell
uv run fastapi dev app/main.py
```

Default local docs:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```

Run tests:

```powershell
uv run pytest
```

Run linting:

```powershell
uv run ruff check .
```

### Windows Container Deployment

The supported image is Windows-only because XMLA uses `pywin32`, Windows COM,
`ADODB.Connection`, and the Microsoft Analysis Services OLE DB Provider
(`MSOLAP`). Do not replace it with a Linux base image unless those dependencies
are revalidated.

Set `MSOLAP_MSI_URL` to the public x64 Microsoft installer URL, then build the
production image:

```powershell
$MSOLAP_MSI_URL = "<Microsoft MSOLAP x64 MSI URL>"
docker build `
  --build-arg "MSOLAP_MSI_URL=$MSOLAP_MSI_URL" `
  -t pbi-lineage-backend:prod .
```

Run the verified local container:

```powershell
docker run --rm `
  --name pbi-lineage-api `
  -p 8000:8000 `
  pbi-lineage-backend:prod
```

The image starts Uvicorn on `0.0.0.0:8000` with one worker. One worker is
intentional until the in-memory Microsoft authentication state and live
Snowflake connector-session ownership are redesigned for shared/multi-worker
operation. Local production-image build and container runtime validation
completed successfully on Windows Server 2025, and the image is now deployed
on AWS Windows ECS capacity.

### Hosted AWS Deployment

The public backend is available at `https://api.<domain>`. The root domain is
intentionally separate so it can host a future frontend.

```text
Cloudflare DNS
  -> AWS Application Load Balancer HTTPS :443
  -> private ECS Windows task HTTP :8000
  -> FastAPI
```

- AWS Region: `ap-south-1`.
- The ECR repository stores immutable images tagged with the full Git SHA.
- The ECS service uses Windows Server 2025 EC2 capacity, `awsvpc` networking,
  and private task IPs. Port `8000` is reachable only from the load balancer
  security group.
- The load balancer redirects HTTP `:80` to HTTPS `:443`; its target group uses
  `GET /api/v1/health` as the health check.
- GitHub Actions authenticates to AWS with OIDC and builds Windows images on a
  dedicated self-hosted Windows runner. ECR build/push is operational; automatic
  ECS rollout after the push is the remaining CI/CD automation step.

## Environment

`.env.example`:

```text
APP_NAME=PBI Lineage Backend
APP_VERSION=0.1.0
ENVIRONMENT=development
API_V1_PREFIX=/api/v1
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
XMLA_TENANT_NAME=myorg
XMLA_PROVIDER=MSOLAP
LINEAGE_DATABASE_PATH=data/lineage.db
LINEAGE_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS=30
LINEAGE_CACHE_MAX_ENTRIES=128
LINEAGE_SCAN_MAX_CONCURRENCY=2
SNOWFLAKE_SESSION_MAX_AGE_SECONDS=2700
SNOWFLAKE_ALLOW_EXTERNAL_BROWSER_AUTH=false
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=[]
ALLOWED_HOSTS=["*"]
FORCE_HTTPS=false
ENABLE_API_DOCS=true
AUTH_COOKIE_SECURE=false
AUTH_COOKIE_SAMESITE=lax
MAX_REQUEST_BODY_BYTES=10485760
EXPOSE_METRICS=true
```

For production, set `AUTH_COOKIE_SECURE=true`, configure explicit
`ALLOWED_HOSTS`, provide `LINEAGE_ADMIN_API_KEY`, and normally disable API docs.
`CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` and `ALLOWED_HOSTS` use JSON-list syntax in environment
variables. SQLite and the in-process scan scheduler match the current
single-worker deployment; move both to shared infrastructure before scaling to
multiple workers or tasks.

Snowflake connector sessions are also process-local and default to a 45-minute
maximum age. Keep `SNOWFLAKE_ALLOW_EXTERNAL_BROWSER_AUTH=false` on hosted
runtimes: the connector opens the browser on the backend host, not in the API
caller's browser. Use OAuth or key-pair authentication for unattended hosting.

XMLA live extraction requires a Windows host with `pywin32` and the Microsoft
Analysis Services OLE DB Provider (`MSOLAP`) installed. The backend opens an
`ADODB.Connection` through COM and passes the Power BI access token in the OLE
DB connection string. The production Dockerfile supplies and verifies these
Windows dependencies in a Windows Server Core LTSC 2025 container. Live XMLA
still needs a Power BI/Fabric capacity with XMLA enabled and a permitted user.

## API Overview

All endpoints are mounted under `/api/v1`.

### Health

```text
GET /api/v1/health
GET /api/v1/health/live
GET /api/v1/health/ready
GET /api/v1/health/metrics
```

### Authentication

```text
POST /api/v1/auth/microsoft/device/start
GET  /api/v1/auth/microsoft/device/status
GET  /api/v1/auth/microsoft/device/{session_id}/status
POST /api/v1/auth/microsoft/device/logout
POST /api/v1/auth/snowflake/session
GET  /api/v1/auth/snowflake/session/status
DELETE /api/v1/auth/snowflake/session
```

Device auth status is intended to show:

- Overall auth status.
- Power BI connection result.
- Fabric connection result.
- Requested scopes.
- Granted scopes.
- Missing scopes.
- Provider error code.

The Snowflake routes create, inspect, and close a separate HttpOnly session
cookie named `pbi_lineage_snowflake_session`. They do not reuse the Microsoft
Power BI/Fabric session.

### Power BI Metadata

```text
GET /api/v1/workspaces
GET /api/v1/workspaces/{workspace_id}
GET /api/v1/workspaces/{workspace_id}/reports
GET /api/v1/workspaces/{workspace_id}/reports/{report_id}
GET /api/v1/workspaces/{workspace_id}/reports/{report_id}/pages
GET /api/v1/workspaces/{workspace_id}/reports/{report_id}/pages/{page_name}
GET /api/v1/workspaces/{workspace_id}/semantic-models
GET /api/v1/reports/{report_id}
```

`GET /api/v1/reports/{report_id}` uses the Power BI **My workspace** endpoint.
It is distinct from the existing workspace-scoped report route.

### Power BI Gateways

```text
GET /api/v1/gateways
GET /api/v1/gateways/{gateway_id}/datasources
GET /api/v1/gateways/{gateway_id}/datasources/{datasource_id}
```

Gateway endpoints require a Power BI token with `Dataset.Read.All` or
`Dataset.ReadWrite.All`, and the authenticated user must be a gateway admin.
Virtual network gateways are not supported by these Power BI APIs. Datasource
responses preserve connection metadata and credential type, but never expose
credential values.

### Unified Lineage

```text
POST /api/v1/lineage/dax/analyze
POST /api/v1/lineage/physical-sources/analyze
POST /api/v1/lineage/snowflake/normalize
POST /api/v1/lineage/snowflake/discover
POST /api/v1/lineage/snowflake/trace
POST /api/v1/lineage/graphs
POST /api/v1/lineage/live-graphs
GET  /api/v1/lineage/graphs/{graph_id}
GET  /api/v1/lineage/graphs/{graph_id}/versions
GET  /api/v1/lineage/graphs/{graph_id}/impact/{node_id}
GET  /api/v1/lineage/graphs/{graph_id}/search
GET  /api/v1/lineage/graphs/{graph_id}/navigate/{node_id}
GET  /api/v1/lineage/graphs/{graph_id}/changes
GET  /api/v1/lineage/graphs/{graph_id}/validate
GET  /api/v1/lineage/estate/discover
POST /api/v1/lineage/scan-jobs
POST /api/v1/lineage/scan-jobs/live
GET  /api/v1/lineage/scan-jobs/{job_id}
```

Graph edges use upstream-to-downstream direction. Containment and semantic-model
relationship edges are marked as non-lineage so downstream impact traversals do
not confuse ownership structure with data flow. Re-saving unchanged graph
content does not create a new version; changed content receives the next SQLite
snapshot version and can be compared through the `changes` endpoint.

When `LINEAGE_ADMIN_API_KEY` is configured, every `/lineage` endpoint requires
the `X-Lineage-Admin-Key` header. Power BI estate discovery additionally uses
the existing authenticated Microsoft session. Gateway `connectionDetails`
parsing is restricted to an allowlist of endpoint metadata and never includes
credential values.

`live-graphs` retrieves parsed Fabric TMDL, optionally retrieves and matches a
report definition, and optionally enriches Power Query sources with accessible
gateway datasource metadata. `scan-jobs/live` runs the same pipeline in the
bounded background-job manager. Neither endpoint persists provider tokens.
The older `/snowflake/discover` route accepts its short-lived credential only
through the `Authorization: Bearer` header and reads
`ACCOUNT_USAGE.OBJECT_DEPENDENCIES` through the Snowflake SQL API. The new
`/snowflake/trace` route uses the authenticated connector session cookie and
calls `SNOWFLAKE.CORE.GET_LINEAGE` for table/column lineage.

### Snowflake Authentication And Deep Lineage

Snowflake authentication and every lineage route are protected by
`X-Lineage-Admin-Key` when `LINEAGE_ADMIN_API_KEY` is configured. Send
credentials only over HTTPS. Request bodies, passwords, tokens, private keys,
and passphrases are not copied into session metadata, logs, persistence, or the
API response. Authentication material exists only in request memory and any
private in-memory state retained by the live Snowflake connector connection.

Common optional connection fields for every method are `warehouse`, `database`,
`schema_name`, and `role`. `account_identifier` is the connector account value,
such as `organization-account`; do not send a full Snowflake URL.

Password authentication:

```json
{
  "authentication_method": "password",
  "account_identifier": "organization-account",
  "user": "LINEAGE_USER",
  "password": "<password>",
  "authenticator": "snowflake",
  "warehouse": "LINEAGE_WH",
  "role": "LINEAGE_READER"
}
```

For username/password MFA, set `authenticator` to
`username_password_mfa`. Supply `passcode` separately or set
`passcode_in_password=true` when the passcode is appended to the password.

RSA key-pair authentication accepts PKCS#8 or PKCS#1 PEM text. Escaped `\n`
newlines are normalized, encrypted keys use `private_key_passphrase`, and the
key is converted to unencrypted PKCS#8 DER only in process memory for the
Snowflake connector:

```json
{
  "authentication_method": "key_pair",
  "account_identifier": "organization-account",
  "user": "LINEAGE_USER",
  "private_key_pem": "-----BEGIN ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----",
  "private_key_passphrase": "<passphrase>",
  "warehouse": "LINEAGE_WH",
  "role": "LINEAGE_READER"
}
```

External-browser SSO is intended only for an interactive local backend and must
be explicitly enabled with `SNOWFLAKE_ALLOW_EXTERNAL_BROWSER_AUTH=true`:

```json
{
  "authentication_method": "external_browser",
  "account_identifier": "organization-account",
  "user": "LINEAGE_USER",
  "warehouse": "LINEAGE_WH",
  "role": "LINEAGE_READER"
}
```

OAuth is the external/unattended option for a hosted API:

```json
{
  "authentication_method": "oauth",
  "account_identifier": "organization-account",
  "user": "LINEAGE_USER",
  "token": "<snowflake-oauth-access-token>",
  "warehouse": "LINEAGE_WH",
  "role": "LINEAGE_READER"
}
```

On successful connection, the backend runs a current-account/user/role/context
query, stores only the live connection plus sanitized identity metadata, and
sets the HttpOnly cookie. Re-authentication closes the previous cookie's
connection. Logout, expiry, or graceful application shutdown also closes the
connection; logout defers connection closure until an active trace finishes.

Trace one table:

```json
{
  "object_name": "ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.SALES",
  "direction": "UPSTREAM",
  "max_depth": 50,
  "max_concurrency": 8
}
```

Trace one column by adding `column_name`; `object_domain` is inferred as
`COLUMN` and must not conflict if explicitly supplied:

```json
{
  "object_name": "ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.SALES",
  "column_name": "NET_AMOUNT",
  "direction": "UPSTREAM",
  "max_depth": 50,
  "max_concurrency": 8,
  "max_nodes": 5000,
  "max_edges": 10000,
  "max_queries": 2000,
  "include_process": true
}
```

The service calls `GET_LINEAGE` with at most five levels. Every object returned
at the five-level boundary becomes a new frontier root; independent roots in a
frontier are queried concurrently up to `max_concurrency`. Stable IDs, visited
roots, and edge deduplication prevent repeated work and cycles. `max_depth`,
`max_nodes`, `max_edges`, and `max_queries` bound each request. A failed root
query fails the request; a failed deeper branch returns the partial snapshot
with `truncated=true` and a `SNOWFLAKE_LINEAGE_BRANCH_FAILED` warning. Returned
`PROCESS` evidence is retained when `include_process=true`.

This ports the supplied procedure's recursive five-level traversal into the
service and supports both table and column roots. It does not create or call
`TRACE_COLUMN_LINEAGE` in Snowflake. The procedure's heuristic `GET_DDL` and
query-history fallback for `COLUMN_TRANSFORMATION`/`MODIFICATION_SQL` is not
executed: that path requires broader history privileges, can disclose SQL text,
and is less authoritative than `GET_LINEAGE`. If Snowflake returns no lineage,
the API returns the root with no inferred edges instead of guessing.

`GET_LINEAGE` is a Snowflake Enterprise Edition feature and each authenticated
role still needs access to the relevant objects; inaccessible objects produce a
Snowflake error.
The backend uses the Python connector directly because Snowpark sessions use
the same connector authentication mechanisms and this integration executes SQL
only; `snowflake-snowpark-python` is not required.

### Fabric Definitions

```text
POST /api/v1/workspaces/{workspace_id}/reports/{report_id}/definition
POST /api/v1/workspaces/{workspace_id}/reports/{report_id}/definition/normalized
POST /api/v1/workspaces/{workspace_id}/semantic-models/{semantic_model_id}/definition
POST /api/v1/workspaces/{workspace_id}/semantic-models/{semantic_model_id}/definition/parsed
GET /api/v1/workspaces/{workspace_id}/semantic-models/{semantic_model_id}/metadata
POST /api/v1/workspaces/{workspace_id}/reports/{report_id}/semantic-lineage
```

Report definition endpoints accept `format=PBIR` or `format=PBIR-Legacy`.
The default is `PBIR`.

Semantic model definition endpoints accept `format=TMDL` or `format=TMSL`.
The default is `TMDL`.

The semantic-lineage endpoint returns visual field matches, source-path
evidence, match confidence, candidate suggestions for unmatched fields, and a
diagnostics summary.

Semantic-lineage query parameters:

- `semantic_model_id` is required.
- `semantic_model_workspace_id` is optional and defaults to the report
  workspace.
- `reportFormat` accepts `PBIR` or `PBIR-Legacy` and defaults to `PBIR`.
- `semanticModelFormat` accepts `TMDL` or `TMSL` and defaults to `TMDL`.

Do not pass `reportFormat=TMDL`; `TMDL` is only valid for semantic model
definitions.

### XMLA Metadata

```text
GET /api/v1/workspaces/{workspace_id}/semantic-models/{semantic_model_id}/xmla/metadata
```

Optional query parameters:

- `workspaceName`
- `databaseName`

This endpoint uses the Power BI token dependency and the XMLA ADODB/MSOLAP
adapter to query `$SYSTEM.TMSCHEMA_*` rowsets for tables, columns, measures,
partitions, hierarchies, levels, and relationships. Workspace names are URI
encoded in the `powerbi://api.powerbi.com/v1.0/{tenant}/{workspace}` endpoint.
If `workspaceName` or `databaseName` is not supplied, the service resolves the
workspace name and semantic model name from Power BI REST before opening the
XMLA connection because XMLA URLs use names, not REST object IDs.

If `pywin32`, Windows COM, or the Microsoft Analysis Services OLE DB Provider
is not available on the host, the client returns
`PROVIDER_INTEGRATION_NOT_CONFIGURED` with a setup message.

### Merged Semantic Model Metadata

```text
GET /api/v1/workspaces/{workspace_id}/semantic-models/{semantic_model_id}/metadata
```

This endpoint requires both Fabric authentication for the TMDL definition and
Power BI authentication for XMLA. It accepts `workspaceName` and `databaseName`
for XMLA name resolution; `format` is intentionally restricted to `TMDL`.

The response preserves both source payloads instead of overwriting one with the
other. Its `reconciliation.matches` list matches tables, columns, measures,
hierarchies, hierarchy levels, partitions, and relationships by normalized
identity and reports `matched`, `definition_only`, or `xmla_only`. TMDL source
paths remain the definition evidence; XMLA provides runtime metadata.

The Phase 3.6-3.14 execution labels are retained for history. Against the
original roadmap, they finish Phase 3 report-level lineage and implement Phase
4 semantic model metadata. The original roadmap numbering above is now the
authoritative phase view; Phase 6.0 remains only a historical execution label.

### Latest Completed Phase

Phase 20 is the latest completed backend implementation phase. Phases 5 through
20 are covered by service/API tests and retain the existing architecture rule
that source evidence is preserved rather than silently overwritten.

### Next Phase

No PowerAI work starts next. The immediate work is live tenant acceptance,
including Snowflake auth/`GET_LINEAGE`, frontend integration, broader DAX/M
fixture coverage, and replacing in-memory auth plus single-instance SQLite/job
coordination before horizontal scaling.

The Phase 3.14 implementation has a tenant-dependent acceptance check that is
not part of local automated testing:

- Validate XMLA extraction against a Premium, PPU, or Fabric capacity with XMLA
  enabled.
- Confirm workspace naming, tenant naming, and semantic model `Initial Catalog`
  behavior with real workspaces.
- Confirm the merged metadata endpoint returns expected source counts and
  reconciliation statuses for a real semantic model.

## Current Review Notes

Phases 3.6 through 20 are locally verified with Ruff and pytest: 197 tests pass.
The only known test-suite warning is a third-party FastAPI/TestClient warning
about Starlette's `httpx` integration.

## Development Notes

- Keep API route handlers thin.
- Put provider HTTP details in `app/clients`.
- Put mapping, polling, decoding, and normalization in `app/services`.
- Keep response contracts in `app/schemas`.
- Use `AppException` subclasses for expected failures.
- Do not log access tokens, decoded payload values, authorization headers, or
  sensitive query strings.
- For Fabric definition changes, test both `200` immediate and `202`
  long-running operation paths.
- For PBIR normalization changes, use small encoded JSON fixture parts.
- Treat locally decoded JWT scopes as diagnostics only.
